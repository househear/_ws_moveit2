## Authors

- Delp S.L., Loan J.P., Hoy M.G., Zajac F.E., Topp E.L., Rosen J.M., Thelen D.G., Anderson F.C., Seth A.
- 3D, 23 DOF gait model created by D.G. Thelen, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, and Ajay Seth, Frank C. Anderson, and Scott L. Delp, Stanford University.
- Lower extremity joint defintions based on Delp et al. (1990).
- Low back joint and anthropometry based on Anderson and Pandy (1999, 2001).
- Planar knee model of Yamaguchi and Zajac (1989).
- Seth replaced tibia translation constraints with a CustomJoint for the knee and removed the patella to eliminate all kinematic constraints; insertions of the quadrucepts are handled with moving points in the tibia frame as defined by Delp (1990).
