## Installation
`moveit_servo` is currently stable on ROS Foxy.

`moveit_servo` can be installed from source as part of `moveit`, roughly following [these instructions](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/source/).

#### Create a workspace
```bash
export COLCON_WS=~/ws_ros2/
mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
cd $COLCON_WS/src
```

#### Download source code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2.git -b main
vcs import < moveit2/moveit2.repos
rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy -y
```

#### Build
```bash
cd $COLCON_WS
colcon build --event-handlers desktop_notification- status- --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Cpp Interface Demo
The simplest demo is the C++ interface demo. In it, a simulated Panda arm is spawned and shown in Rviz, along with a collision object.

First, a simple joint command is sent to the arm for a few seconds.

Then, a simple, repeating Cartesian command is sent indefinitely. Eventually the arm will slow and stop as it approaches the collision object (although commands are still being published).

#### To run
```bash
source $COLCON_WS/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch moveit_servo servo_cpp_interface_demo.launch.py
```

## Component Demo
`moveit_servo` is also offered as a composable node that may be run in a container with other components.

This demo starts a `moveit_servo` instance in a container with the `tf` publisher. Commands may be sent to the arm by publishing to the `moveit_servo` input topics, and the `moveit_servo` behavior may be controlled by its offered services.

#### To run
```bash
source $COLCON_WS/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch moveit_servo servo_server_demo.launch.py
```

To start the `moveit_servo` and publish a steady command, open a new terminal and run:
```bash
source $COLCON_WS/install/setup.bash
ros2 run moveit_servo fake_command_publisher
```

## Teleoperation Demo
`moveit_servo` is a versatile tool for teleoperating a manipulator. Inputs can include generic `TwistStamped` or `JointJog` commands, collisions can be detected and avoided, and singular positions can be avoided.

The teleoperation demo spawns a Panda arm and shows it in Rviz with a few simulated tables. Then it uses `moveit_servo` to control the arm following user inputs with a game controller.

This demo was written for an Xbox 1 controller, but can easily be modified for any generic gamepad that works with the [Joy package](https://index.ros.org/p/joy/#foxy).

#### To run
Make sure your controller is plugged in and can be detected by `ros2 run joy joy_node`. Usually this happens automatically after plugging the controller in.

Open a terminal and run
```bash
source $COLCON_WS/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch moveit_servo servo_teleop.launch.py
```
You should now be able to input commands via the controller. Default supported actions include Cartesian and joint commands, and switching the frame of the Cartesian commands.

Please note the controller overlay is for demonstration purposes and is not part of the actual demonstration.
